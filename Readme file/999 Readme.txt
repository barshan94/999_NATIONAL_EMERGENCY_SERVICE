Project details:

This is a web application which helps every citizen of our country at their emergency needed. This project contains one login button, registration button, update button and exit button at first form.
Firstly there are no credentials to log in. So every user must complete registration to use this application. Every new user is requested to complete their registration process from registration button.
After registration they have to remember their nid and password to login.

After login they will get all the emergency option which is necessary into our daily life.

They can access police dispatcher, fire dispatcher, ambulance, covid special service and more services which contain women and child prevention cell, anti corruption, child helpline, doctor and govt services.
It is noted for all users that one person can send request only once at every button. When their request will be processed they can send request again.
If any users need to update their details they can update without changing nid.

Here, NID is a primary key which can never be changed.

Moreover, there is a login table which will help to track the current user of our application. When anyone will login their details will be sent in that form and when they logout their details will be deleted from that form. In the meantime it will show only the logged in user.
There is an admin page to monitor each and every user and their requests. Admin can modify requests and they will take proper actions.

In short, this is our a simple effort to make everyone's life a little bit better and get used to all users with Digital Bangladesh.
